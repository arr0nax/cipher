# Cipher

#### A Way To Encode Messages, March, 2017

#### By **Clayton Collins**

## Description

This app allows users to encrypt and decode messages using a keyword and a simple shift cipher. It supports both forward and backward ciphering, and randomly generates a keyword used to decipher the message. Don't forget to save both the message and the keyword!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Begin MAMP or similar service in the root directory
* Make sure you have a database called `cipher` in mySQL
* Navigate to localhost:8888 in your web browser
* use the admin name and password `cipher` to initialize the site
* Create ciphers using the create tab and decrypt them using 'decrypt'


## Known Bugs

No known bugs, but hopefully in the future I can add some functionality to store messages, display them to users, and keep track of keywords.
