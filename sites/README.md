# Cipher

#### A Way To Encrypt Messages, March, 2017

#### By **Clayton Collins**

## Description

This app allows users to encrypt a message and then decrypt it later using a randomly generated keyword.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Point MAMP to the top level of the cipher directory
* If you want to edit the site, create a new database in mySQL called `cipher` and a user with all privileges named `cipher` with password `cipher`
* Navigate to localhost:8888 (or whatever your MAMP is configured too for local hosting) in your web browser
* Don't forget to save the message and keyword for when you want to decipher your message!


## Known Bugs

No known bugs at the moment. Possible ideas for improvement are to randomly generate the shift and direction along with the keyword, and attach keywords to user accounts so that decryption could be more automatic.
